# Contributing to AutoCRM

We love your input! We want to make contributing to AutoCRM as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Keep components small and focused
- Document complex logic
- Write tests for new features

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
2. Update the documentation with details of any new environment variables, exposed ports, etc.
3. The PR may be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
