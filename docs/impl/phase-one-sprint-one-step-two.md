# Database Design Implementation Checklist

## Supabase Schema Design

- [x] Set up Supabase project
    ```bash
    supabase init
    supabase start
    ```
- [x] Create core tables:
    - [x] Tickets table
    - [x] Users table (auth.users extension)
    - [x] Ticket history table
    - [x] Ticket metadata table
    - [x] Conversations table
    - [x] Teams table
    - [x] Team members table
- [x] Define relationships:
    - [x] Ticket to user relationships
    - [x] Ticket to history relationships
    - [x] Ticket to metadata relationships
    - [x] Team to member relationships
- [x] Set up indexes:
    - [x] Search indexes
    - [x] Performance indexes
    - [x] Foreign key indexes

## Database Migrations

- [x] Create initial migration:

    ```sql
    -- Enable UUID extension
    create extension if not exists "uuid-ossp";

    -- Create tables
    create table tickets (
      id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
      title text not null,
      description text,
      status text not null,
      priority text not null,
      created_at timestamptz default now(),
      updated_at timestamptz default now(),
      assigned_to uuid references auth.users,
      customer_id uuid references auth.users
    );
    ```

- [x] Set up migration scripts
- [x] Create seed data
- [x] Document migration process
- [x] Test migration rollbacks

## Row Level Security (RLS)

- [x] Configure authentication policies:
    - [x] User registration
    - [x] Login policies
    - [x] Password policies
- [x] Set up ticket access policies:
    - [x] Customer access
    - [x] Agent access
    - [x] Admin access
- [x] Configure conversation policies:
    - [x] Read permissions
    - [x] Write permissions
    - [x] Delete permissions
- [x] Set up team-based policies:
    - [x] Team member access
    - [x] Team leader permissions
    - [x] Cross-team policies

## Realtime Subscriptions

- [x] Configure realtime settings:
    - [x] Enable realtime for tickets
    - [x] Enable realtime for conversations
    - [x] Enable realtime for user status
- [x] Set up broadcast channels:
    - [x] Ticket updates channel
    - [x] Chat channel
    - [x] Notification channel
- [x] Implement realtime filters:
    - [x] User-specific filters
    - [x] Team-specific filters
    - [x] Priority-based filters
- [x] Add realtime security:
    - [x] Channel authorization
    - [x] Subscription policies
    - [x] Rate limiting

## Testing and Validation

- [x] Create database tests:
    - [x] Schema validation
    - [x] RLS policy tests
    - [x] Relationship tests
- [x] Test migrations:
    - [x] Forward migration
    - [x] Rollback scenarios
    - [x] Data integrity
- [x] Validate realtime:
    - [x] Subscription performance
    - [x] Event delivery
    - [x] Security rules
- [x] Performance testing:
    - [x] Query optimization
    - [x] Index effectiveness
    - [x] Connection pooling
