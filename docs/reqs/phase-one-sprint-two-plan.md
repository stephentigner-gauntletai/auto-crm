# Sprint Two: Ticket Management System

## Duration: 3 weeks

## Goals
- Implement core ticket functionality
- Create ticket routing system
- Develop search and filtering capabilities

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### 1. Core Ticket Features

#### CRUD Operations
- Implement endpoints for:
  ```
  POST /api/v1/tickets
  GET /api/v1/tickets/:id
  PUT /api/v1/tickets/:id
  DELETE /api/v1/tickets/:id
  ```
- Add validation middleware
- Implement error handling
- Create request/response DTOs

#### Metadata Management
- Implement status tracking:
  - New
  - Open
  - Pending
  - Resolved
  - Closed
- Add priority levels:
  - Critical
  - High
  - Medium
  - Low
- Create tagging system:
  - Tag CRUD operations
  - Tag associations
  - Tag-based queries

#### Conversation System
- Implement threaded conversations:
  - Message creation
  - Reply handling
  - Conversation tree structure
- Add support for:
  - Rich text
  - File attachments
  - @mentions
  - Internal notes

### 2. Ticket Routing & Assignment

#### Rule-Based Assignment
- Create rule engine for:
  - Tag-based routing
  - Priority-based routing
  - Time-based routing
- Implement rule conditions:
  - Customer attributes
  - Ticket content
  - Time of day
  - Current queue status

#### Load Balancing
- Implement workload distribution:
  - Agent availability tracking
  - Queue length monitoring
  - SLA compliance checking
- Create balancing algorithms:
  - Round-robin
  - Least busy
  - Skill-based
  - Priority-weighted

#### Team Management
- Create team structure:
  - Team CRUD operations
  - Member management
  - Role assignments
- Implement team features:
  - Team queues
  - Team metrics
  - Shift management

#### Skills-Based Routing
- Create skills system:
  - Skill definitions
  - Agent skill profiles
  - Skill requirements for tickets
- Implement matching algorithm:
  - Skill level matching
  - Multiple skill requirements
  - Fallback routing

### 3. Search & Filtering

#### Search Implementation
- Set up search engine (Elasticsearch):
  - Index configuration
  - Mapping setup
  - Analyzer configuration
- Implement search features:
  - Full-text search
  - Fuzzy matching
  - Relevance scoring

#### Filter System
- Create filter types:
  - Status filters
  - Priority filters
  - Date range filters
  - Agent filters
  - Team filters
  - Custom field filters
- Implement filter combinations:
  - AND/OR operations
  - Nested filters
  - Saved filters

#### Sorting & Pagination
- Implement sorting:
  - Multiple sort fields
  - Sort direction
  - Default sorting
- Add pagination:
  - Page size limits
  - Cursor-based pagination
  - Result count
  - Performance optimization

## Dependencies
- Elasticsearch
- Redis (for caching)
- PostgreSQL
- Queue system (RabbitMQ/Redis)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All CRUD operations working and tested
- [ ] Metadata system fully functional
- [ ] Conversation system implemented
- [ ] Routing rules working correctly
- [ ] Load balancing operational
- [ ] Team management system complete
- [ ] Search and filtering performing efficiently
- [ ] All features have adequate test coverage

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Search performance with large datasets
  - *Mitigation*: Implement proper indexing and caching strategies
- **Risk**: Complex routing rules causing delays
  - *Mitigation*: Optimize rule engine and use caching
- **Risk**: Load balancing fairness
  - *Mitigation*: Regular monitoring and algorithm tuning
